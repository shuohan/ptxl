Use the observer design pattern to record training process. The basic idea is to implement a class `Trainer` as the subject of the observer design pattern, and use observers to validate models, save checkpoints, print out training progress, etc.

## Install

```bash
pip install git+https://gitlab.com/shan-deep-networks/pytorch-trainer.git
